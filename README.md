# EvolvingClusters: Online Discovery of Group Patterns in Mobility Data

A Python3 implementation of the EvolvingClusters algorithm.



## Installation

Install the dependencies included with the following command
``` Python
pip install -r requirements.txt
```


## Usage

EvolvingClusters can be used in two variations, depending on the use-case. If EvolvingClusters is part of general online pipeline, the ```evolving_clusters_single``` method should be used, as the following example suggests:

```Python
import pandas as pd
from EvolvingClusters import evolving_clusters_single

df = Dataset_Pandas_DataFrame

active = [pd.DataFrame(), pd.DataFrame()] # The active patterns list
closed = [pd.DataFrame(), pd.DataFrame()] # The closed patterns list

for incoming_timeslice in df.groupby('timestamp'):
    ...
    active, closed = evolving_clusters_single(timeslice, distance_threshold=1852, min_cardinality=5, time_threshold=15, active_patterns=active, closed_patterns=closed)
    ...

evolving_clusters_tp = [pd.concat(active_tp, closed_tp) for active_tp, closed_tp in zip(active, closed)]
```

To use EvolvingClusters in standalone mode, the ```evolving_clusters``` method should be used, as suggested by the following example:

```Python
import pandas as pd
from EvolvingClusters import evolving_clusters

df = Dataset_Pandas_DataFrame

evolving_clusters_tp = evolving_clusters(df, min_cardinality=5, time_threshold=15, distance_threshold=1852)
```



## Kafka Implementation

Except (baseline) Python applications, EvolvingClusters can also be used as part of data streaming pipelines. The ```EvolvingClustersKafka.py``` script demonstrates that, by integrating the algorithm into the popular data streaming platform, [Apache Kafka](https://kafka.apache.org/).

The aforementioned script loads a CSV file into a Kafka Topic, consumes it (one message at a time), and saves the aligned timeslices as well as the discovered evolving clusters into their respective Kafka Topics, ready to be used by another application.

More regarding the operation of ```EvolvingClustersKafka.py``` can be found at ```doc/ec_kafka_tr.pdf``` and ```lib/README.md```.
